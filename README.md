# 2020 Inter-school Cooperation Curriculum Game Development Lecture Tasks

This repository **was** archive of inter-school cooperation curriculum game development lecture tasks. But recently, I'm updating this project little by little to enjoy it with my friends.  

## What the hell is this game?
Maybe advance the "Roll a Ball" Game. But players must jump up to a specific spot, and don't need to roll a ball.

## Run Game
Because of copyright issues, I omitted BGM files. So, You must replace music files.

Target files:
```
./Assets/Sounds
Conteminated Sea.mp3
Memory of Sunset.mp3
Secret Labyrinth.mp3
```
 * You can also find omitted BGM list from the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file.
